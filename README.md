#Hi ‚úåÔ∏è, Im Evan Ross
### Data Analyst from New Jersey
I've always been huge into technology. Computers, components, data, and code have always been interests of mine. After diving into the world of data analytics and python in general, a whole new understanding interest and curiosity derives from basic use of everyday things. From the games I play, to the programs I use, I ask everyday, "How is this coded?" I love being able to think, and ponder ideas of how the most common pieces of technology are created and used. 

Following this, my goal is to work in the cosmos, for the research and development of space travel and the deep understanding of the universe. Using what I learned and plan to learn, I want to work for a large space corporation and develop models and code to better understand what is outside of our world. Some of my projects are posted, feel free to take a look. Im very eager to learn and grow within this field and excited to advance further.
